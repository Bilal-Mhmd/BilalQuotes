          <p class="lead">Born in Moscow in 1821,
            Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales and legends,
            and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was 15, and around the
            same time, he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute. After graduating, he worked
            as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books to earn extra money. In the
            mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk,
            which gained him entry into St. Petersburg's literary circles.</p>

          <p class="lead">Mary Oliver was born to Edward William and Helen M. (Vlasak) Oliver on September 10, 1935,
            in Maple Heights, Ohio, a semi-rural suburb of Cleveland. Her father was a social studies teacher and an
            athletics coach in the Cleveland public schools. As a child, she spent a great deal of time outside where
            she enjoyed going on walks or reading. In an interview with the Christian Science Monitor in 1992, Oliver
            commented on growing up in Ohio, saying

            "It was pastoral, it was nice, it was an extended family.
            I don't know why I felt such an affinity with the natural world except that it was available to me,
            that's the first thing. It was right there. And for whatever reasons, I felt those first important
            connections,
            those first experiences being made with the natural world rather than with the social world."</p>

          </h2>
          <p class="lead">T. S. Eliot was an American-British poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, literary critic and
            editor.
            Born in St. Louis, Missouri, to a prominent Boston Brahmin family, he moved to England in 1914 at the age of
            25 and went on to settle, work and marry there.
            He became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39, subsequently renouncing his American citizenship.<br>
            Considered one of the 20th century's major poets, Eliot attracted widespread attention for his poem "The
            Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" (1915), which was seen as a masterpiece of the Modernist movement.</p>
